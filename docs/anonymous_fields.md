# Anonymous fields

If you do not want to serialize field names, you do not have to use `rfl::Field`. You can just write your struct like this:

```cpp
struct Person {
  std::string first_name;
  std::string last_name;
  std::vector<Person> children;
};
```

This is referred to as anonymous fields. It is particularly relevant if you are using a binary format.

This can be fully serialized and deserialized using `rfl::json::read` and `rfl::json::write`. No further annotations are needed.

However, there are a two things you have to keep in mind:

1) If you annotate *some* of the fields using either `rfl::Field` or `rfl::Flatten`, then you must annotate *all* of them using one of these two.
2) If you are combining structs using `rfl::Flatten`, then all fields in all structs must be annotated using either using either `rfl::Field` or `rfl::Flatten`.
